# Learning to Smell Challenge

This repository is dedicated to [Learning to Smell challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/learning-to-smell) organized by AIcrowd. My best Jaccard score prediction is 0.346 (the 1st round).

## Challenge

You use machine learning (or any other related methods/techniques) to build and train model using the available dataset (4316 molecules) and predict the smells of a given test set (1079 molecules). There are 109 odors present in the dataset ([data/vocabulary.txt](data/vocabulary.txt)). More details can be found on the website of the competition.

#### Dataset
1. train.csv - (4316 molecules) : This csv file contains the attributes describing the molecules along with their "Sentence"
2. test.csv - (1079 molecules) (Round-1) : File that will be used for actual evaluation for the leaderboard score but does not have the "Sentence" for molecules.
3. vocabulary.txt : A file containing the list of all odors present in the dataset

#### Evaluation

Jaccard (Tanimoto) score

## My neural network

My neural network is designed with feedforward neural network using Keras/TensorFlow backend. The features (descriptors) that I used to train a model is Morgan fingerprint and structural properties such as functional groups, number of benzene rings, van der Waals volume, etc.

## Steps to reproduce my score

1. Calculate Morgan fingerprints with 8192 bits using RDKit.
2. Build a model containing 3 hidden layers with 128 neurons each.
3. DropOut and batch normalization are also applied.
4. Compile model with Adam optimizer. Use Categorical entropy as loss function and use accuracy as metric.
5. Train model for 300 epochs. Reduce learning rate and early stop techniques are also applied.
6. Predict the smells.
7. Choose the top 15 smell predictions for each sample (molecule) and group by 3.
8. Submit the prediction results (.csv) and get the score. Example of submission file is [this file](data/submission/RK_1/submission.csv)
